## Compile

To compile a C file into an output file, you can use the `gcc` compiler. Here is the command you can use:

```sh
gcc -o output_file_name source_file.c
```

For example, if your source file is `main.c` and you want the output file to be `main`, you would use:

```sh
gcc -o main main.c
```

This will compile `main.c` and create an executable file named `main`.

## Run

To run the compiled C file, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```sh
./output_file_name
```

For example, if your output file is named `main`, you would use:

```sh
./main
```

This will execute the compiled C program.
